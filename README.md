# Master Script Repository

This repository contains the `master.sh` script, designed to simplify the execution of other scripts stored in a GitHub repository. The `master.sh` script automatically fetches a list of available scripts, allows you to select and run them, and handles dependencies and cleanup. This guide explains how to use the `master.sh` script, its key features, and how to contribute.

The goal of the repo is to make is as simple as possible to run scripts that are stored in a GitHub Repo.

** For ease of access, the link `https://scripts.pitterpatter.io/master.sh` can be used to get `master.sh` **

### Running with Verbose Output

If you want to see more detailed output during execution, use the -v flag:

```bash
bash master.sh -v
```

### Selecting and Running Scripts

1. Fetch List of Scripts: The script automatically fetches the list of available scripts from this repository.
2. Select a Script: You will be prompted to select a script to run from the list of available scripts.
3. Run the Script: The selected script is downloaded, executed, and then cleaned up after execution.


## Features

- Automatic Dependency Installation: Ensures that required tools like sudo, curl, and jq are installed before proceeding.
- Script Fetching and Execution: Automatically retrieves available scripts from the repository and allows for easy selection and execution.
- Verbose Mode: Use the `-v` flag to enable detailed logging during script execution.
- Error Handling: Built-in error handling ensures that the script exits gracefully and provides informative error messages.
- Cleanup: Automatically removes temporary files and the script itself after execution.


## Dependencies

The `master.sh` script relies on the following tools:

- `sudo`: Ensures elevated permissions for installing packages and running scripts.
- `curl`: Used to fetch the list of scripts and download individual scripts.
- `jq`: Parses JSON responses from GitHub API.
If any of these tools are not installed, the script will attempt to install them automatically.

The script also uses `task_formatter.sh`, which can be found at the [TaskFormatter Repo](https://github.com/pitterpatter22/TaskFormatter/blob/main/bash_task_formatter/task_formatter.sh), to format the output of the master script in a better looking way. 

## Error Handling

The script includes robust error handling mechanisms:

- Command Failures: If a command fails (e.g., network issues, missing dependencies), the script will output an error message and exit.
- Invalid Script Selection: If an invalid selection is made, the script will prompt you to try again.
- HTTP Status Codes: When downloading a script, the script checks the HTTP status code and provides feedback if the download fails.

## Cleanup

After running the selected script(s), the master.sh script performs the following cleanup actions:

- Temporary Files: Removes any temporary files created during script execution.
- Self-Removal: Deletes the `master.sh` script itself and the `task_formatter.sh` script used for output formatting.
- These actions ensure that your system remains clean after script execution.
